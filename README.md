## Description

A heroku-deployed note-taking site that allows the user to create and delete notes for themselves. The aim of developing this program was to teach myself how to connect front-end and back-end code using express js and heroku.

## Installation:

If the user intends to use this program locally, they will need to run "npm i" from their CLI to install the necessary packages. If they are using the Heroku-deployed site, no installation is necessary.

## Usage

Link to the deployed app: https://note-taker800.herokuapp.com/

The user can click "get started" to navigate to the notes page. Any note can be clicked to view its content, and the "plus" icon in the top right can be clicked to create a new note. The user can type a title and content for their new note, and may save their new note by clicking the save button in the top right. If desired, the user can delete a note by clicking the red trash icon next to it in the list.
